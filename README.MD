# C ACTIVIES LISTS  

## Lists of C exercises for practicing for C Programming Language course  
---

### Description  
During the C programming language course, several activities were elaborated to practice C. These activities were spread across four lists, Each list is inside a directory with contain, along with the .c files, a .pdf or .txt file with the description of each exercise. In the future, probably the activities description will be translated to english.

## Final considerations  
Since C, in general, gives the possibility of solving and elaborating stuff in many ways, the solutions in these activities doesn't necessarily means that is the best way.  
I created the repository to share the solutions with coleagues and everyone who is interested and can find this useful somehow. Any suggestion for improvments is welcome.
